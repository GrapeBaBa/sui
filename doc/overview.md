# Overview

FastX is a distributed ledger that stores a collection of programmable *objects*, each with a globally unique ID. Every object is owned by a single *address*, and each address can own an arbitrary number of objects.

The ledger is updated via a *transaction* sent by a particular address. A transaction can create, destroy, and write objects, as well as transfer them to other addresses.

Structurally, a transaction contains a set of input object ID's and a pointer to a Move code object that already exists in the ledger. Executing a transaction produces updates to the input objects and (if applicable) a set of freshly created objects along with their owners.

A transaction whose sender is address *A* can only accept objects owned by *A*, with one exception: a transaction can read from immutable objects regardless of their owner.
